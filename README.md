Space Station Site

This page is an example home page for a Space travel company. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

Treehouse Air BnB

This page is an example home page for a Air BnB in the trees. It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

Calculator Project

I developed a simple web-based calculator with a modern design that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

TicTacToe

I designed a classic game of Tic Tac Toe that features visual flashes and incorporates sound effects.

Portfolio [Under-construction]

This page was the first iteration of the later revised Final Project Portfolio.
